# What this is
The repo is a decent starting framework for creating an FVTT package.  It's a collection of things I've used in other packages, so you'll need to change out names throughout.

## Support

I'm happy to do this for free, as I primarily work on things I like to use myself.  But if you'd like to [buy me a root beer](https://ko-fi.com/phloro), I love knowing that people are using my projects and like them enough to make the effort. It's really appreciated!
