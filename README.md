# What this is
The repo is a decent starting framework for creating an FVTT package.  It's a collection of things I've used in other packages, so you'll need to change out names throughout.

# Package name

[![Supported Foundry Versions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://foundryshields.com/version?url=https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-autocomplete-mentions/raw/master/static/module.json)](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-autocomplete-mentions)

## Features

## Issues?

If you believe you found a bug or would like to post a feature request, head over to the module's [Github repo](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-autocomplete-mentions) and [open a new issue](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-autocomplete-mentions/issues/new/choose).

## Support

I'm happy to do this for free, as I primarily work on things I like to use myself.  But if you'd like to [buy me a root beer](https://ko-fi.com/phloro), I love knowing that people are using my projects and like them enough to make the effort. It's really appreciated!  

## Credits

Autocomplete Mentions is the result of the effort of many people (whether they know it or not). Please refer to [CREDITS.md](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-autocomplete-mentions/blob/master/CREDITS.md) for the full list.


## How to Contribute
You can build the project either with local node or using a dev container.  In either case, make sure these environment variables are set:
```
FOUNDRYVTT_APP=<absolute path to your foundry installation>
FOUNDRYVTT_DATA=<absolute path to your foundry data directory>
```

`npm install` to get started.

`npm run linkdata` will create a symlink between the output directory and your foundry modules data.  Then `npm run debug` will compile the project and update Foundry.  You'll still need to activate the module in your game to test it.
